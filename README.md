## What is SurveyX?

**SurveyX** is an advanced academic survey automation system that leverages the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to generate high-quality, domain-specific academic papers and surveys. 

By simply providing a **paper title** and **keywords** for literature retrieval, users can request comprehensive academic papers or surveys tailored to specific topics.

## How It Works

SurveyX automates the process of generating academic content. Here's how it works:

1. **Submit an Issue**: To request a paper, simply create a new issue with the **desired paper title** and **keywords** related to the topic you'd like the paper to focus on. These keywords will be used for literature retrieval and content generation.
2. **Paper Generation**: Based on your request, SurveyX uses its powerful LLM system to generate a paper, incorporating relevant content, citations, and survey questions drawn from a curated literature database.
3. **Receive the Paper**: After generating the paper, it will be delivered to you. You can request revisions or further refinements if necessary.

## How to Submit an Issue

To request a paper, create a new issue with the following details:

- **Paper Title**: Provide the title or a brief description of the paper you need.
- **Keywords for Literature Search**: Provide key terms or phrases that will help retrieve relevant literature and guide the content generation (e.g., "AI in healthcare," "climate change impact on agriculture").

### Example Issue Submission:

**Title**: Paper on the Impact of AI in Healthcare
 **Keywords**: AI, healthcare, ethical implications, technology adoption, AI-driven diagnostics

SurveyX will retrieve literature related to these keywords and generate a paper based on your request.

## Disclaimer

SurveyX uses advanced language models to assist with the generation of academic papers. However, it is important to note that the generated content is a tool for research assistance. Users should verify the accuracy of the generated papers, as SurveyX cannot guarantee full compliance with academic standards.
