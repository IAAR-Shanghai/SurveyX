## 🤔What is SurveyX?

**SurveyX** is an advanced academic survey automation system that leverages the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to generate high-quality, domain-specific academic papers and surveys.🚀

By simply providing a **paper title** and **keywords** for literature retrieval, users can request comprehensive academic papers or surveys tailored to specific topics.

If you're curious about how SurveyX works or want to understand the underlying technology and methodology, feel free to check out our 📑[research paper](http://www.surveyx.cn), where we provide an in-depth explanation of the system's architecture, data processing methods, and experimental results.

## 🖋️How to Request a Custom Paper via Issue

To request a paper, create a new issue with the following details:

- **Paper Title**: Provide the title of the paper you need.
- **Keywords for Literature Search**: Provide keywords separated by commas that will help retrieve relevant literature and guide the content generation (e.g. "AI in healthcare, climate change impact on agriculture, ethical implications of AI").

### 💬Example Issue Submission:

**Title**: Controllable text generation of LLM: A Survey
 **Keywords**: AI, healthcare, ethical implications, technology adoption, AI-driven diagnostics

Once your request is submitted, the generated paper will be placed in the **user requests** folder. Please allow 1-2 business days for processing and generation. ⏳

## ⚠️Disclaimer

SurveyX uses advanced language models to assist with the generation of academic papers. However, it is important to note that the generated content is a tool for research assistance. Users should verify the accuracy of the generated papers, as SurveyX cannot guarantee full compliance with academic standards.
